## About me
 
I’ve started my way into programming and algorithms with Java. It doesn’t mean that I’m a pro in the back-end. It just means that I understand the Java syntax and OOP.

I’ve always been good at math but my way of Frontend was very implemented.

I’m interested in Architecture and Art. I understand something in Civil engineering and Renovation. Also, I have good teaching skills (I think so) and sometimes I’m in the spotlight. Because I like to connect with people, make jokes and be a serious person at the same time..

So if you read it welcome to my Universe. And nice to meet you, friend =)
